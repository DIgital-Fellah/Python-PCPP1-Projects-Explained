# Control torques would typically be computed by a control algorithm

# Note: The code above is a basic framework and does not include the actual
# kinematic and dynamic calculations. These calculations are complex and
# involve matrix operations and transformations which should be added in the
# respective methods (update_kinematics and update_dynamics).

# Further developments could include:
# - Adding graphical user interface (GUI) integration to visualize the robot
# - Implementing networking capabilities for multi-robot scenarios
# - Enhancing the simulation with more realistic physical properties and control algorithms

# This basic framework provides a starting point for developing a more complete
# and functional robotics simulator.
